}
\arguments{
\item{A_CLAY_MI}{(numeric) The clay content of the soil (\%)}

\item{A_SILT_MI}{(numeric) The silt content of the soil (\%)}

\item{B_LU_BRP}{(numeric) The crop code from the BRP}

\item{B_SOILTYPE_AGR}{(character) The agricultural type of soil}

\item{B_GWL_GLG}{(numeric) The lowest groundwater level averaged over the most dry periods in 8 years in cm below ground level}

\item{B_GWL_GHG}{(numeric) The highest groundwater level averaged over the most wet periods in 8 years in cm below ground level}

\item{B_GWL_ZCRIT}{(numeric) The distance between ground level and groundwater level at which the groundwater can supply the soil surface with 2mm water per day (in cm)}

\item{calcyieldloss}{(boolean) whether the function includes yield loss, options: TRUE or FALSE (default).}
}
\description{
This function calculates the workability of soils, given as a value of relative season length between 0 and 1. 
A relative season length of 1 indicates that the water table is sufficiently low for the soil to be workable for the entire growing season required by the crop.
The required ground water table for workability is determined by soil type and soil properties. Hydrological variables determine the groundwater table for each day of the year.
The option calcyieldloss allows for calculation of yield loss based on the relative season length, differentiating in yield loss between six groups of crops
