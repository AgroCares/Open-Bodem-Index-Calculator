<p>In practice, agricultural soils have multiple functions and
contribute to various ecosystem services. Soils ensure good agricultural
production, buffer water and nutrients, store carbon, provide a habitat
for soil organisms and facilitate aboveground biodiversity. In recent
years, therefore, research has been conducted from all angles into the
opportunities that sustainable soil management offers for improving the
quality of the living environment. By improving soil management and
identifying any bottlenecks in soil quality, a better balance can be
found between the various ecosystem services and between agriculture and
the environment. Sustainable soil management is therefore not only
relevant for farmers and nature managers, but also for water boards and
drinking water companies. For them, soil provides relevant ecosystem
services such as water storage, water purification and nutrient
buffering. Soil properties and soil management therefore influence the
quality and availability of groundwater and surface water where they
manage or extract water.</p>
<p>The OBIC was developed in 2019 by a consortium of WUR, FarmHack and
NMI and is an initiative of Rabobank, a.s.r. and Vitens. The primary
focus of the current OBIC (version 1.0) is on the agricultural functions
that a soil fulfils. Within the project “Healthy Soil, Healthy Water
System”, drinking water companies have focused on soil quality
assessment from an environmental perspective, focusing on groundwater
quality and quantity. An earlier report by Geurts et al. (2021) proposed
to expand the OBIC to include functions for groundwater recharge, water
storage, nitrogen efficiency, and crop protection product leaching.
These functions were to assess how soil and its management contribute to
groundwater quality and quantity. The functions were developed and
tested in the summer of 2021 on four plots originating from groundwater
protection areas managed by Vitens. The results were discussed during a
workshop with the participating farmers and stewards, site managers and
ecologists. This report describes the newly developed functions as well
as their evaluation as a result of the workshop and further data
analysis.</p>

<h3 id="ground-water-recharge">Ground water recharge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ground-water-recharge"></a>
</h3>
<p>The groundwater recharge is primarily controlled by the precipitation
surplus based on crop evaporation. The quality of the soil then
determines what part of the precipitation surplus actually infiltrates
into the groundwater. To map this groundwater recharge, first the
precipitation surplus is calculated, and then this surplus is corrected
for two other soil quality characteristics, namely the rate at which
water can infiltrate (derived from the unsaturated permeability,
I_WRI_K) and the risk of soil sealing (I_P_SE). These soil
characteristics give an indication of how much water infiltrates and how
easily. The indicator value derived from this is then corrected if the
soil is compacted or if the plot is drained.</p>
<p>If the soil is compacted, the indicator score is reduced by 20%
because it is more difficult for water to infiltrate and therefore the
water holding capacity will be lower. This correction is independent of
soil type, land use or groundwater depth. In reality, the influence of
compaction on the infiltration rate depends on the extent of soil
compaction and the moisture situation of the soil at the time of a rain
shower. There can be great variation here between and within plots.
Because this information is not yet available at this level of detail, a
generic reduction has been chosen here depending on the risk of soil
compaction.</p>
<p>The correction for a higher drainage flux only takes place with
shallower groundwater levels (at groundwater levels IIIb and IV) and the
presence of drainage: in that situation the indicator score is reduced
by 40%. Under wet and drained conditions a considerable part of the
precipitation surplus will flow to the surface water. This concerns a
first estimate; further substantiation and detailing (spread), for
example based on soil moisture models, is needed for a reliable estimate
for different conditions. The depth of drainage in relation to the
presence of subsoil compaction (a plough’s sole or deeper) also plays a
role here. Because this data is not available per plot from generic
data, this can only be shaped within the current UBI by getting
information through a Soil Condition Score. The correction factors for
compaction and drainage are not applied simultaneously, because it is
assumed that drainage has a greater impact and compaction is less
relevant if the field is already drained.</p>
<p>The calculation of the indicator score can be found in the formula
below. Here the precipitation surplus weighs more heavily than the two
soil characteristics that influence water infiltration. Therefore, the
contribution of soil to groundwater recharge can be calculated via: (0.7
* Precipitation surplus + 0.15 * Infiltration + 0.15 * Sealing) *
cf_compaction/cf_drainage</p>

<h3 id="precipitation-surplus-and-unsaturated-permeability">Precipitation surplus and unsaturated permeability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#precipitation-surplus-and-unsaturated-permeability"></a>
</h3>
<p>The groundwater recharge function, <code>calc_gw_recharge()</code>,
uses precipitation surplus and unsaturated permeability, among other
things. The precipitation surplus function uses long-term weather
averages for precipitation and potential evaporation from KNMI. For each
crop, the growing season and the Makkink correction factor per month are
known (TNO and Commissie voor Hydrologisch onderzoek 1988). Thus, based
on the cultivated crop (the cropping plan) and the presence of catch
crops, the actual evaporation and precipitation surplus per month can be
calculated. The calculation rules can be viewed in more detail on the
github page of the Open Soil Index Calculator. The formula for
calculating the precipitation surplus is as follows: P_surplus = P -
(ETpot * cf_Makkink).</p>
<p>P stands for precipitation in mm, ETpot is the potential
evapo-transpiration in mm and cf_Makkink is the Makkink correction
factor. The figure below shows how precipitation surplus is assessed in
light of sustainable land use and protection of groundwater recharge. A
large proportion of crops have a precipitation surplus of around 400 mm
per year. With an annual average precipitation of 850 mm, the
precipitation is thus calculated to be equally distributed between crop
and groundwater. Therefore, it was decided to assign an indicator score
of 1 starting from a precipitation surplus of 400 mm (black line). Since
grassland has a higher evapo-transpiration compared to cropland, the
score for grassland is calculated using a different formula, it reaches
a score of 1 at a precipitation surplus of 250 mm (grey line).</p>

<p>The OBIC already contains a function for saturated permeability, this
was then converted to unsaturated permeability based on Wösten et
al. (2001). The formula for this conversion is as follows:
<img src="Formula_K-unsaturated.png" width="45%" height="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Here Ksat is the saturated permeability in m/d, h is the hydraulic
head at the inflection point, the parameters α, n and l determine the
shape of the curve and are calculated with the OBIC function
pFpara_ptf_Wosten2001. The logistic function for assessing the indicator
score can be found below.</p>

<h3 id="nitrogen-use-efficiency">Nitrogen use efficiency<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nitrogen-use-efficiency"></a>
</h3>
<p>The OBIC already contains a function for nitrogen leaching (in the
form of nitrate), but it only calculates leaching based on the nitrogen
supply capacity of the soil, independent of fertilization practices. The
new function, <code><a href="../reference/calc_n_efficiency.html">calc_n_efficiency()</a></code>, which aims to protect
groundwater quality given agricultural use, calculates the nitrogen
surplus from applied manure. The formula for this calculation is as
follows: N_surplus = (1 - NUE * cf(P,K,pH)) * N_fertilization *
fr_applicationspace - catchcrop</p>
<p>The surplus is calculated by multiplying the amount of applied N by
the nitrogen use efficiency, NUE (this is a fraction). If the phosphate
and potassium levels are sufficient and the pH of the soil is optimal
for crop growth, it is assumed that the NUE is higher. Therefore, when
availability for P, K is high and pH is goed (a OBI score for these
functions higher than 9), NUE is increased by 10% using the correction
factor cf(P,K,pH). This function also includes a variable for the
fraction of the application space that is utilized
(fr_applicationspace). This is because if the nitrogen supply of the
soil is high, less fertilization is needed to meet the crop requirement.
In addition, the function assumes an uptake of 75 kg N ha-1 by catch
crops (CDM, 2017). For the time being it is assumed that part of this
nitrogen is added to the soil organic matter in the year after tillage
(thus increasing the N-delivery capacity) and part is taken up by the
succeeding crop. Based on the nitrogen surplus and leaching fractions
determined for soil type, land use and groundwater level, the leaching
to groundwater is calculated. The fraction of the nitrogen surplus that
leaches to groundwater as nitrate (mg NO3 L-1 per kg N surplus) were
calculated using the modeling tool STONE (Groenendijk et al., 2016). The
calculated value for nitrogen leaching is then used to calculate the
indicator score. Because there is a small overlap with leaching from N
supply, it is worth considering integrating the two functions in the
future.</p>
<p>Once the soil’s contribution to high nitrogen utilization has been
identified, it can also be assessed in light of protecting groundwater
quality. For this purpose, a logistic assessment function is used: soils
with a (relative) nitrate leaching higher than 25 mg NO3 L-1 have a high
risk of deteriorating groundwater quality and therefore receive a lower
soil quality assessment. Since the legally allowed concentration for
nitrate in groundwater is 50 mg NO3 L-1, soil quality was chosen to be
rated as extremely poor (score = 0) once the leaching exceeds this
critical standard. To improve soil quality such that little nitrate
leaches out, soil quality is assessed such that the score decreases
sharply from a leaching of 20 mg NO3 L-1.</p>

<h3 id="pesticide-leaching">Pesticide leaching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pesticide-leaching"></a>
</h3>
<p>The sensitivity of the soil to pesticides leaching is calculated by
the function <code>calc_pestide_leaching()</code>, using a meta-model of
the leaching model PEARL, as described by Tiktak et al. (2006). This
meta-model calculates what fraction of a pesticides leaches to a depth
of 1 meter. The formula used for the meta-model is as follows:
fr_leaching = exp((-0.34 / 60 * ((vfw + BD * OM * K_om )) / flux ).</p>
<p>In the formula, vfw is the volume fraction of water in m3 m-3 , in
the OBIC this is the indicator D_WRI_WHC, BD is the bulk density in kg
dm-3, OM is the fraction of organic matter in kg kg-1, Kom is the
coefficient for the distribution of pesticides between organic matter
and water in dm3 kg-1, finally, flux stands for the vertical water flux
in m d-1.</p>
<p>To map the attenuating effect of the soil on the leaching of
pesticides, a so-called worst-case scenario is calculated, where the
leaching is calculated for a very persistent pesticides. For this
purpose, a Kom value of 10 dm3 kg-1 is used (Tiktak et al., 2006). Note
that the OBIC hereby provides insight into the role of soil quality in
reducing leaching; it does not provide an evaluation of aboveground
resource use. To quantify the role of soil as well as soil management in
preventing pesticides of leaching, first each soil is compared to a soil
that is unable to degrade or bind pesticides. This is done for soils
with extremely low organic matter content. This minimum organic matter
content is determined by taking the 0.001 quantile per soil type for all
plots in the Netherlands. A relative score is calculated by dividing the
leaching fraction by the maximum leaching that could have occurred if
the soil had not been properly managed. Because the effect of soil
management (including management measures around the use of pesticides)
is also taken into account within the OBIC, this information can
additionally be used to assess the risk of leaching. If measures are
taken to reduce the use of pesticides, such as the use of biological or
mechanical weed control or decision support systems, the leaching
fraction for the current situation is reduced by 25%.</p>
<p>In a situation with an OM content of 3% and a precipitation surplus
of 400 mm, the risk score for all soils except peaty clay is around
0.92. If the OM content is increased to 6% the score goes to a value of
0.84. If measures are taken to use less pesticides, these scores drop to
values around 0.7 and 0.6 respectively. With an OM content of 15%
(occurring in reclaimed peat soils) and application of measures, the
risk score further decreases to a value around 0.5. Therefore, it was
decided to assess the leaching risk as shown below. With a lower
precipitation surplus, the leaching fraction decreases, because the
vertical water flux becomes smaller. Therefore, a higher score can be
obtained for pesticide leaching. However, a lower precipitation surplus
has a negative effect on the groundwater recharge score, a trade-off.
Since a precipitation surplus of 400 mm has been identified as optimal
in the precipitation surplus function, this value was used for
calibration of this indicator score.
